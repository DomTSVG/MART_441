# Homework 8 Readme/Report

## The Good

Another tough assignment, though obviously only because of the application of learned ideas. Despite that, this assignment was great to help refresh some of the things I learned in Creative Coding and working things into animation is easy enough, when everything is set up correctly. The things we can do with this... Possibilities aren't endless, as there's a technical limit to the permutations, but nonetheless are expansive.

## The Bad

As I stated, though, learning where and how to apply certain things we've learned is still tough. I find myself needing refreshers on how to set up functional arrays from time to time, and I'll forget every time that there needs to be a separate creation for each object. Getting better, though.

## The Ugly

One thing in general that I had an immensely hard time with was timing. I had an issue where I wasn't able to get the images to fade out before moving the square to their position, which meant that it overlapped. I figured out that in order to make the image fade before the square moved to prevent overlap, I needed to make separate variables for image position and square position. For some reason I think I understand (something to do with when the variables are updated in what I call, in my head, the code initiative) the function that moved the image wouldn't trigger correctly, or at all, if the variable for the square's position didn't change. Maybe I could have kept it at one variable, but this solution works for me and that's, frankly, all that matters.
