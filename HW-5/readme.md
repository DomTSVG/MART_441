# Homework 5 Readme/Report

## The Good

Part I - While arrays still give me a bit of a headache setting this us was as easy as can be. With the help of this week's example and some prior knowledge of tables, I figured out what I wanted to do pretty quickly. Utilizing the examples to build the actual functions for flipping the darn things, I took some time to work on the design aspect... Right after I finished fixing my own silly mistakes. I'll be honest; the easy part about arrays is understanding how to use them to set up groups of variables. How that gets used is a different story.

## The Bad

Part 1 - Each time I do things like this I run into minor hiccups. This time around was no different; one of the minor things I needed to work on was actually helping my functions, well, function. The funny thing is that all I was missing, in general, was a curly brace or two. I need to get better at catching those kinds of things. It took me too long to figure it out.

## The Ugly

Part A - And finally, what coding session is complete without some frustration? Arrays and setting them up (properly) definitely gives me a headache. I need to work on some more Codecademy for them or something, because I'll be honest, I was scratching my head while trying to work them into functions. I have no doubt that as the weeks go by I'll be more and more out of my league. Practice, practice, practice.
