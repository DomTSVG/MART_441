# Homework 9 Readme/Report

## The Good

Sadly, not a lot here. Beyond setting up some of the visual elements and setting up my Jquery plugin, I just didn't have a lot of good this session.

## The Bad

I messed up quite a bit with the background-image css tag and needed assistance, I don't know how or why. Switching to a different structure of file than I normally run likely was what did it.

## The Ugly

Oh man, the ugly was ugly. I spend 4 out of 5 hours the day I'm writing this readme trying to wrap my head around AJAX, and I still have a really hard time with it. I'll be honest and say I feel incredibly, insanely dumb after working through this assignment, to the point I'm now exhausted. I'll try and practice this one if I have time. Essentially, figuring out how I was even going to call to the data set I wanted was a nightmare for me and now afterwards I feel like I should have been faster at figuring it out, maybe I wouldn't have left it until this close. In any case, I also needed a lot of help structuring my functions, but with some help I worked it out.
