# Homework 7 Readme/Report

## The Good

I love writing descriptions for things, and honestly I loved writing the class for this assignment. No, seriously. Of everything, I think that my favorite thing that I did was jot down the data and make it into objects. It's strange to me that the building of this little tool, which, honestly is not that impressive visually, was more fun than tweaking the visuals. This assignment's work will serve me well in that modding work I talked about last time.

## The Bad

Damn if I didn't have a hard time figuring out how to get past that, though. I have trouble understanding exactly why some of this stuff works, though at the end of the day I think I have a basic idea. If the creation of the class and objects was the easy part, the hard part was figuring out how to set up all the "get" stuff without breaking my code every which way.

## The Ugly

And if the "get" stuff was the hard part, the calling and cycling of images was even worse. I spent too much time trying to get the functions to work and to call the proper values from the arrays, and by the end of the day I was finally able to get everything to work by referencing back to the example. (Thank god.)
