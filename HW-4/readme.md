# Homework 4 Readme/Report

## The Good

After hours of work, fiddling and getting assistance, I finally have what I want. None of it was easy, that's for sure. At the very least, at the end of the day, I was able to effectively get the whole thing running and working. The game uses your name over the storyline, the game reduces your HP to zero when you die through a For loop, and there's various other small things like level color and hp color changing, functions that execute changes, and the whole thing resetting with the exception of your randomized stats. It took a lot of hurt to get where I am for this assignment. Here's hoping that it wont hurt as much next time.

## The Bad

The For loop that functions as the HP counter is practically useless, though it is functional. My original idea was to use a for loop with a delay to tick down the health number until it hit zero, but after doing some research and serious fenagling the best I could do was delay something before or after the loop had finished getting the value to zero, not during. I have zero idea why it didn't function correctly using the set timeout function, or any other function I tried. It would have been so cool if it had worked. I theoretically could have set it to go outside of the loop, but then the loop would serve even less of a purpose.

## The Ugly

I still have no idea how to get a while loop to function outside of the given examples. Everything I tried with the loop didn't work; I couldn't get it to run consistently until the script on-screen had changed like I wanted, I couldn't get it to work properly in any context that meant anything. I'll have to work on how those loops, including a do-while loop, actually work, but for now I'm still having serious trouble.
