# Homework 12 Readme/Report

## The Good

Playing with these kinds of systems is a lot of fun, I definitely think that each and every one of these features can help with making all sorts of cool games. I enjoyed just swapping out sprites and changing up things, may look into building something more complex at a later date for sure. I not only changed the player sprite but I also added a top left platform, included spikes, changed the jump button to the spacebar, and changed the gravity of the stars and made the star gravity randomize.

## The Bad

I had a hiccup while making the spikes/saws and changing the gravity. Essentially, with the spikes I hadn't included all the necessary lines to properly make them. Easy enough. For changing the gravity of the "stars" I had to look up an example online and work it with what we had.

## The Ugly

The hardest thing this week was actually the sprites themselves. I found the phaser guy's sprite sheet to be way too big, so when I made my sheet instead I constrained the sprites to make the hurtbox more believable. Took me some time.
