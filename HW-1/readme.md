## The Good

Considering I've been away from coding sites in Atom for months, if not more than a year, this first assignment went alright. I got into the groove a bit later, despite needing a refresher on some things. Styling with color, borders, alignment and everything else came kind of naturally after remembering which damn tag I had to use. This along with the actual formatting of each individual section was what gave me hope that I might not bomb this class. Hooray!

## The Bad

Of course, this wasn't without its hiccups. I'm still not fully understood on the parallax and I wish I could get it to work more smoothly with what I wanted, and could keep it from just ending like it did. Making it work better with the background, or making it the entire background, would have also helped me along. Future research will likely help me with that, but it's still disappointing. Oh well, nothing like a little failure to kick you in the pants, right? I've got more and more learning to do... And relearning, come to think of it. Here's to keeping myself sane.

## The Ugly

Hoo boy, the images gave me so much trouble in this project and I couldn't tell you why. Specifically, I was hoping to have the images beside the text boxes, not within them, but I have yet to figure out if there's something in particular I'm missing that is making that impossible. My code doesn't seem to want to allow me to float them separately, so maybe I'll look back into tabling in the future for this kind of formatting.
