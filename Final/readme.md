# Final Project Readme/Report

## The Good

It's done, and it's over. I'm actually kind of sad, honestly. I'm going to miss this class, and I've been more than motivated to really push myself in terms of creativity. I hope that this last project is enough to show how much I enjoyed my time this semester. I put a lot of hard work and effort into it, and even though it's simple, I hope you have fun.

Putting everything together on here was more than a joy. It was a pleasure. Even though there's very little writing, it's enough to make a playable game. It's not too long, but long enough to occupy some time. It may be a bit unbalanced, but that's what patches are for, right?

## The Bad

I had quite a bit of trouble with the equipping at first; I ended up changing a lot about the project over the course of these two weeks and streamlined quite a few processes. I think it was worth it, but there were a lot of little, technical hiccups that needed to be overcome.

## The Ugly

The worst of these hiccups was with damage calculation and stat refreshing. I had messed something up so simple and I did hours of troubleshooting trying to find out what was going wrong. Yes, I forgot to use two equal signs in an if statement. It took me four hours to find that out. Oh well, at the end of the day, even if Ammo is broken in that the last shot you can fire is technically when you have 2 left in your inventory, or if melee is easy mode, I otherwise couldn't be happier with the final product.

## It's over, isn't it?

Thank you, Michael Cassens, for a truly awesome semester. I wish I had more time to take future classes, you really know how to run them. Keep doing what you're doing (and ask for a raise while you're at it.) I'll see you when we next cross paths.
