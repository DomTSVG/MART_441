# Homework 3 Readme/Report

## The Good

I can't tell you how happy I am to have finished this in the state I did. I... Love this, I really do. Every step of picking what I wanted the paths to be to picking out the various references was fantastic. Building a simplistic little game was amazing and it's taught me that I could possibly make my own browser game at some point. I wonder if you've ever played KoL, or if you feel like giving it a try as of now. I am so, so happy with the finished product. The easiest thing, probably, was the writing and organizing of it all, which is something I do a lot. Neat things are nice to look at after all. I had no problem actually getting the writing to update either!

## The Bad

Of course, no good assignment is without its hiccups. I had a rough time this week working through the content and I needed to steal quite a bit from the example to get everything actually working variable and function wise. I need to work on building functions and variables from scratch. Additionally, several times I messed up and forgot closers... "</div>" and ";" like closers. Several times my whole site broke and I wasn't sure why. Oh well.

## The Ugly

My biggest problem this time around was that I wanted to introduce a new variable but I couldn't get it to work right. Even after hours of work, that additional variable wouldn't write as anything other than undefined. I was going to use it to have the page recognize which ending you got and display it after you finished, but it's still just out of my reach.
