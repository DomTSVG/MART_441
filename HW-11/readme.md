## The Good

Making games is hard work, but it's also an incredibly rewarding experience. It's not perfect but I think that this game recreation I've done is one of the best so far. It's not too shabby, even if the collision is really sensitive. I enjoyed picking out more of those sprites and trying new things.

## The Bad

Honestly  I wish I could have animated the sprites, it's such a shame. Some kind of "passed-in" error is making it so that I can't update the sprites over time to give the illusion of motion. That's also okay.

## The Ugly

The real kicker was getting to where I am in the first place. The creation of my motion and working the arrays and JSON files was tricky. I needed a lot of assistance this week and I'm not proud of it. It doesn't matter much in the long run, but hopefully next time I can keep things stable enough not to bother everyone. Especially over something as simple as not using strings in my JSON files.
