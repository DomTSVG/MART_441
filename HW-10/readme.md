## The Good

Everything went near perfectly this time around! I'm not even kidding when I say that this was a fun project to do. I thought about several ideas for my game and landed on designing it after Stardew Valley's "Journey of the Prairie King" game. It's basic, but it's much better than what I thought I could make.

## The Bad

I don't know why the bottom boundary is so weird. I may have to tweak it a little sometime, but for now I can't get it to work exactly right.

## The Ugly

Nothing bad here, really. Honestly. And after last week, this is a godsend. I couldn't be happier with this final product. Possible improvements could include a timer and highscore, if I feel like adding them.
