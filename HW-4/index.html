      <p>"Howdy <span id="intextname">friend</span>, and welcome to the afterlife!"</p>
      <p>You feel your senses coming back to you and your eyes open to a clear blue sky and clouds above and below you. Your head hurts like a bad hangover and your entire body aches distantly, which is to say your body <b>should</b> be aching, but it's not. You cast a quick glance down at yourself and you're but a shadow of your former self, a spirit!</p>
      <p>You pick yourself up (or rather, you float yourself up) and face down a wispy looking person carrying a clipboard and wearing a funky hat. Your mind starts to clear a bit and he speaks up again.</p>
      <p>"So, you're dead, that much must be obvious to you at this point." He taps his finger-analogue (seriously, he doesn't even look like he has any) against his pen as he goes over the board. "Problem is, our watcher was off on break while you bit the dust so we have no idea what you were just doing."</p>
      <p>He looks up at you expectantly. "So pal, what were you doing before you died just now?"</p>
