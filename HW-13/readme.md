## The Good

Basic 3D modeling is rough, and when it's literally the one thing I don't at least try to do on the regular it's even more so. Still, using the library to make basic 3D models was fun, and positioning and rotating each to create my "drill" (if you can see it, great, if you can't I understand) was rewarding. Yeah, if you cant tell, this is supposed to be a drill boring into an emerald. My artistic prowess knows no bounds.

## The Bad

Adding color to my gemstone model was a challenge, I had to google a solution and apply it, and even then I'm not entirely sure how it works. At least now the thing is green and I can stop stressing about it so much. Life's all about the small victories, right?

## The Ugly

I cannot and could not figure out how to animate my gemstone model. No matter what I tried I couldn't get the little bastard to move in any meaningful way, which means I may be behind on this project. If I can get it animated by the time this is being read it will be a miracle, but for now I've hit my wall for this project. (Spoiler alert, I did.)
