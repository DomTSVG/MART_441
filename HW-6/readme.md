# Homework 6 Readme/Report

## The Good

Hooray! Finished the game, and not a moment too soon. I swear, this gave me all kinds of stress aneurisms with how close it came, but now that it's all done I'm really happy. Did you know that I was actually interested in learning JSON in particular before this? True story. Stardew Valley is a game I've played a lot and it can be modded. I've even created some basic mods for it. However, more complex mods that work better require the use of a modding API and, more importantly, JSON to function. Hopefully I'll be able to take this knowledge and apply it over there. I had a lot of fun making this week's assignment, and I only ever ran into issues at the very end, so hooray! I'm especially happy with the design and the comments at the end. Fun!

## The Bad

Apparently, finding the right order to log things is tough. I had some trouble getting particular values to log to the console every now and again and I don't know why. I also had to tweak the timeout on certain functions because I ended up making them a little too long, and it made it easy to break the game.

## The Ugly

JSON. Apparently I'm not quite there yet, and I have so, so much to learn about how to call it, how many times, how to read it, and more. I stumbled through the finish line out of breath on this one thanks to not quite understanding how JSON gets called properly. I thought I had it right, I could get the console to log the pulled JSON from local storage, but to no avail. More research is necessary.
